# Spam Classification Project

This repository contains a Python-based solution for detecting spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Overview
This project aims to classify messages as either spam or non-spam. The dataset used for training and testing contains labeled examples of messages, and the notebook demonstrates the complete workflow:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature extraction using NLP techniques
3. Model training and evaluation

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named `Spam_Classification.csv`.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab or Google Colab Account
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow`, `nltk` and `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow nltk
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mehtab-Sidhu/spam-classification
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam-classification
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Spam_Classification.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to explore the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The model achieves competitive accuracy in classifying spam and non-spam messages.
